### General

- [ ] All active GitHub checks for tests, formatting and security are passing (CI Pipeline)
- [ ] The correct base branch is being used.
- [ ] Documentation for new / changed functionality is added or updated (if documentation is present)
- [ ] Test for reproducing the bug / new business logic (e.g. viewmodels, services and so on) are implemented
- [ ] Errors are handled and/or least logged
- [ ] Log messages and comments are written in english
- [ ] There are no (debug) console logs or _useless_ / _trivial_ comments
- [ ] Disabled linter rules are explained via comment
- [ ] Variables, method, classes and so on should have meaningful names (longer is better that meaningless)
- [ ] No ambiguous code was implemented - code intent is clear upon initial reading (if not possible, it should get properly documented)
- [ ] DRY principle (no duplicate without a good reason) is followed
- [ ] Methods can handle unexpected input properly
- [ ] Each feature has its corresponding feature / subfeature folder with corresponding widgets, viewmodel and so on
- [ ] The folder structure stays consisted as described in the tech stack
- [ ] Hard coded / static values (magic numbers) are avoided (add the static values to forseen files)

### Typescript / Javascript

- [ ] All files are written in typescript
- [ ] There is a blank line between module imports and own file imports
- [ ] Arrow functions are preferred over normal functions
- [ ] User inputs are being validated properly (with error messages if needed)
- [ ] The code sticks to the prettier and eslint code standards
- [ ] Await/async is preferred over chaining then callbacks
- [ ] TypeScript code compiles without any warnings / errors
- [ ] Everything should get type (no any -> use things like unknown instead and map the type)

### Flutter

- [ ] The utils folder does only contain file definitions or extensions (put everything else in the core module)
- [ ] If accessing data from shared preferences or remote api, an own content feature was implemented in the content module
- [ ] Private members should preceded with an underscore
- [ ] Class members are sorted according to [Flutter's styleguide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo)
- [ ] All strings except logs are localized
- [ ] No relative imports are being used except if the file is in the same directory
- [ ] There should be no more then one named parameter per line
- [ ] No `buildWidget()` methods are being used do to performance issues (use private widgets instead)
- [ ] Widgets in the `lib/widgets` folder shouldn't contain paddings or margins by default
- [ ] No `IconData` is used as a widget parameter in public widgets
- [ ] Code reusability is guaranteed with helper functions in the core module and reusable designed widgets in separate folders
- [ ] Hard coded / static string in the ui screens are avoided (add the static values to forseen files)
- [ ] ListView builder should be used for long lists in order to improve performance
- [ ] Widgets are split in meaningful helper widgets to improve readability
- [ ] The widget should take care of responsiveness of the application (use widgets which handle screen overflows like expanded)
- [ ] The feature / bug fix was tested on android and (if possible) ios
- [ ] The build method should be pure without any side effects (because it may be triggered my external factors such as route push / pop)
- [ ] Business logic is separated from the ui with viewmodels
- [ ] Provide only at needed level instead of providing everything at the top to reduce widget rerenders
- [ ] Providers are not watched for single function calls (only read)
- [ ] All third party packages were evaluated and testet (especially after upgrading flutter)

## ðŸ‘‹ Getting started

Welcome to trophoria! This repository contains an ansible playbook which is used to easily setup a secured remote linux server to run a whole trophoria backend.

If you want to contribute to our community projects, we advice you to fist read through our [wiki pages](https://github.com/trophoria/.github/wiki). If you for example want to learn, how we set up our development environment, you can read our [Development setup](https://github.com/trophoria/.github/wiki/2-Development-setup). This repository itself contains more useful information like pull request templates, security guidelines and so on. Make sure to read those too!

This repository contains our linting configurations we use in our typescript and flutter projects. 

### Typescript

Install both linting packages for `eslint` and `prettier` via yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D @trophoria/eslint-config @trophoria/prettier
```

Now add the following configuration to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "prettier": "@trophoria/prettier-config",
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [ "@trophoria/eslint-config" ]
  }
}

```

### Flutter

Add the linting package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  trophoria_lints:
    git: 
      url: https://github.com/trophoria/trophoria-lints.git
      path: trophoria-flutter
```

Now you can include the config in your `analysis_options.yaml` file:

```yaml
include: package:trophoria_lints/lints.yaml
```
